# Site Header

At the top of every BYU page should be the University header.  It includes a BYU Logo, the name of the current site, user login/logout, site search, and a limited number of links.

## General Layout

The site header spans the width of the user's viewport and is 55 pixels tall. The background is navy, and text is white.

On the left side of the header is a white version of the [BYU institutional monogram](https://identity.byu.edu/institutional/logos/monogram/)
followed by the site-specific title and a subtitle or supertitle.

On desktop, the right site is occupied by site-specific actions, user login/logout, 
and site search.  On mobile, the right side has a button to trigger a dropdown menu containing site action links, user login/logout, and navigation, and the search field moves below the blue bar.

## Logo and Site Title

The layout of the logo and site title remain the same at all screen sizes.

The logo, [available here](https://cdn.byu.edu/shared-icons/latest/logos/monogram-white.svg),
is 114px wide and 33px tall. It is positioned 16px from the left side and 11px from the top. There are 16px between the right edge of the logo and the left edge of the site title.

In mobile layouts, it is possible that the top bar will expand vertically in order to accomodate
long site title.  In this case, the logo keeps the same positioning.
