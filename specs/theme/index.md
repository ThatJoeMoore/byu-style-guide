# BYU Web Theme
BYU’s web theme provides a consistent user experience across campus, while also offering flexibility for varying communications needs. To meet these two objectives—consistency and flexibility—the theme includes a header and a footer but leaves the main content area available for customization. The header and footer are mobile responsive and can be used in any content management system or programming environment.

The focus on a consistent header and footer provides a familiar start and finish for all university web pages; it also offers a uniform navigation scheme that users can become accustomed to across BYU’s web space. All BYU web sites should use the theme.
