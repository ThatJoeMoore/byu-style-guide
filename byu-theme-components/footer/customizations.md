# Footer Customizations
By default, if you have set a _max-width_ or _full-width_ attribute on byu-header, byu-footer will discover and use that setting. If you wish to override the header's setting, you can specify the attributes on byu-footer by setting _max-width_ on the byu-footer to any arbitrary pixel value.

## Columns
The standard default is to have 4 column regions, however you may have 2-5 column regions depending on content.

__Column Width:__ Columns may be double-wide by adding the class "double-wide". Similarily you can have a triple-wide column by adding the class "triple-wide" to the byu-footer-column element.

## University Footer
This is not customizable, it should always stay the same.
